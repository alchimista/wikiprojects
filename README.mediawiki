== Wikitools patches ==

Right now, you have to patch your copy of Wikitools a bit to get some of this to work. In future, we should just make a class, but for now...

* ''wikitools/wiki.py.setSiteInfo: '' apply [http://code.google.com/p/python-wikitools/issues/detail?id=40 this patch] to line 109.

* ''wikitools/page.py.edit:'' add 'sectiontitle' to the list of valid args.


== Tables ==
MySQL database tables are used to track relevant metrics about your project, 
such as who was invited, who visited, and which wikipages are included.

=== invited_yourprojectname ===
This table provides a log of the users who have been invited to the Project. 
You populate the majority of the metadata with a query like [https://github.com/jtmorgan/wikiprojects/blob/master/pt_wikipedia/findNewEditors.py#L64 this one].

 +-------------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | Field             | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
 +-------------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | id                | int(11) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
 | user_id           | int(11)          | YES  | UNI | NULL    |                |
 | user_name         | varbinary(200)   | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | user_registration | varbinary(14)    | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | user_editcount    | int(11)          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | sample_date       | datetime         | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | invited           | tinyint(1)       | YES  |     | 0       |                |
 | bot_invited       | tinyint(1)       | YES  |     | 0       |                |
 | bot_skipped       | tinyint(1)       | YES  |     | 0       |                |
 | user_talkpage     | int(11)          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | ut_is_redirect    | tinyint(1)       | YES  |     | 0       |                |
 +-------------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

The script that [https://github.com/jtmorgan/wikiprojects/blob/master/pt_wikipedia/inviteNewEditors.py invites these users] 
to your project then updates the <code>invited, bot_invited</code> and <code>bot_skipped</code> columns.


=== pages_yourprojectname ===
This table provides a log of the pages in your project space. Project members often create new pages 
(i.e. WikiProject_Cats/Members, Teahouse/Host_lounge/Announcements).
Having an updated list of the pages in your project space makes it easier to keep track of who is editing what: 
for instance, it makes it easier to find out when users you invited to your project start participating.

 +-------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | Field       | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
 +-------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | id          | int(11) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
 | page_id     | int(11)          | YES  | UNI | NULL    |                |
 | p_title     | varbinary(255)   | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | p_namespace | int(11)          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 +-------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

You can keep this table up to date by running a query like this one on cron:
<code>insert ignore into th_pages (page_id, page_namespace, page_title, page_touched) select page_id, 
page_namespace, page_title, page_touched from enwiki.page 
where page_namespace in (4,5) and page_title like "YourProjectName/%";</code>

=== articles_yourprojectname ===
Most WikiProjects are focused on editing articles within particular categories. If you are trying to get people to 
participate in your WikiProject, you probably want to know when they edit articles related to those WikiProjects.
But reading through the entire <code>categorylink</code> table takes a long time. It may be easier to create a local lookup
table that contains the names and pageids of all the articles you're interested in tracking. That table might look
something like this: 

 +-------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | Field       | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
 +-------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | id          | int(11) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
 | page_id     | int(11)          | YES  | UNI | NULL    |                |
 | p_title     | varbinary(255)   | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | p_namespace | int(11)          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 +-------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

You can then find edits to your project's articles by users you invited to the project with a fairly speedy query like this:
<code>SELECT * FROM somewiki.revision AS r, yourdb.invited_yourprojectname AS i, yourdb.articles_yourprojectname AS a WHERE 
r.rev_user = i.user_id AND r.rev_page = a.page_id;</code>

You can populate this table with articles from multiple super- and sub-categories 
(e.g. WikiProject_Milkshake_articles, Milkshake_stubs) by reading the category tree. There are multiple ways to do this
(API, <code>somewiki.categorylinks</code>, [http://toolserver.org/~magnus/catscan_rewrite.php external tools]). 
In Reading the Category Tree below, I describe how to do this by querying the Mediawiki database.

== Reading the category tree ==
It is in fact relatively easy (though in some cases somewhat time-consuming) to reconstruct a category tree from the MediaWiki database.

;Reading down the tree
For example, lets say you want to get all the subcategories of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:WikiProject_Anatomy_articles WikiProject Anatomy Articles]:

<code>select * from categorylinks where cl_to = "WikiProject_Anatomy_articles" AND cl_type = "subcat";</code>

You see that there are four subcategories. Now you want to get the subcategories of one of those categories, such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Anatomy_articles_by_importance Anatomy articles by importance]:

<code>select * from categorylinks where cl_to = "Anatomy_articles_by_importance" AND cl_type = "subcat";</code>

Cool! Now you want to see if one of those subcategories also has subcategories:

<code>select * from categorylinks where cl_to = "Mid-importance_Anatomy_articles" AND cl_type = "subcat";</code>

That returns 0 rows, because there are no subcategories to this category. But if you change the cl_type you're looking for to "page", you'll see that there are lots of pages in that subcategory, most of which will probably not be listed under the parent category (unless someone has explicitly added both a parent and child category to the same page, which does happen, so as you read down the tree you'll have to screen out duplicates and/or assign some pages both primary and secondary categories)

<code>select * from categorylinks where cl_to = "Mid-importance_Anatomy_articles" AND cl_type = "page";</code>

So... the moral of the story is that this can be scripted up to output all the pages and subcategories under any given parent category. You can put these into a table like articles_yourprojectname to more efficiently monitor who's doing what on the articles your project is interested in.

;Reading up the tree
It's a little trickier, but still doable, to read the tree backwards. You can't look at cl_type: the only types are 'page', 'subcat' and 'file'.

<code>select cl_type from categorylinks where cl_type NOT IN ("page", "subcat", "file") limit 1;</code>
...returns 0 rows :(

There's no 'supercat', 'is_subcat', 'is_parent' or anything.

So you have to see if the sub-category page itself (cl_from) is listed categorized under a broader category, by matching page_id = cl_from. So for example this page: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Anatomy_articles_by_importance http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Anatomy_articles_by_importance]

...is categorized under 'WikiProject Anatomy Articles' and 'Wikipedia 1.0 assessments', which you can see in the database with a query like this:

<code>select * from enwiki.page as p, enwiki.categorylinks as c where p.page_id = c.cl_from and p.page_namespace = 14 and p.page_title = "Anatomy_articles_by_importance";</code>
