== Wikitools patches ==

Right now, you have to patch your copy of Wikitools a bit to get some of this to work. In future, we should just make a class, but for now...

* ''wikitools/wiki.py.setSiteInfo: '' apply [http://code.google.com/p/python-wikitools/issues/detail?id=40 this patch] to line 109.

* ''wikitools/page.py.edit:'' add 'sectiontitle' to the list of valid args.


== Tables ==
MySQL database tables are used to track relevant metrics about your project, 
such as who was invited, who visited, and which wikipages are included.

=== invited_yourprojectname ===
This table provides a log of the users who have been invited to the Project. 
You populate the majority of the metadata with a query like [https://github.com/jtmorgan/wikiprojects/blob/master/pt_wikipedia/findNewEditors.py#L64 this one].

 +-------------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | Field             | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
 +-------------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | id                | int(11) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
 | user_id           | int(11)          | YES  | UNI | NULL    |                |
 | user_name         | varbinary(200)   | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | user_registration | varbinary(14)    | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | user_editcount    | int(11)          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | sample_date       | datetime         | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | invited           | tinyint(1)       | YES  |     | 0       |                |
 | bot_invited       | tinyint(1)       | YES  |     | 0       |                |
 | bot_skipped       | tinyint(1)       | YES  |     | 0       |                |
 | user_talkpage     | int(11)          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | ut_is_redirect    | tinyint(1)       | YES  |     | 0       |                |
 +-------------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

The script that [https://github.com/jtmorgan/wikiprojects/blob/master/pt_wikipedia/inviteNewEditors.py invites these users] 
to your project then updates the <code>invited, bot_invited</code> and <code>bot_skipped</code> columns.


=== pages_yourprojectname ===
This table provides a log of the pages in your project space. Project members often create new pages 
(i.e. WikiProject_Cats/Members, Teahouse/Host_lounge/Announcements).
Having an updated list of the pages in your project space makes it easier to keep track of who is editing what: 
for instance, it makes it easier to find out when users you invited to your project start participating.

 +-------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | Field       | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
 +-------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | id          | int(11) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
 | page_id     | int(11)          | YES  | UNI | NULL    |                |
 | p_title     | varbinary(255)   | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | p_namespace | int(11)          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 +-------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

You can keep this table up to date by running a query like this one on cron:
<code>insert ignore into th_pages (page_id, page_namespace, page_title, page_touched) select page_id, 
page_namespace, page_title, page_touched from enwiki.page 
where page_namespace in (4,5) and page_title like "YourProjectName/%";</code>

=== articles_yourprojectname ===
Most WikiProjects are focused on editing articles within particular categories. If you are trying to get people to 
participate in your WikiProject, you probably want to know when they edit articles related to those WikiProjects.
But reading through the entire <code>categorylink</code> table takes a long time. It may be easier to create a local lookup
table that contains the names and pageids of all the articles you're interested in tracking. That table might look
something like this: 

 +-------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | Field       | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
 +-------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | id          | int(11) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
 | page_id     | int(11)          | YES  | UNI | NULL    |                |
 | p_title     | varbinary(255)   | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 | p_namespace | int(11)          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 +-------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

You can then find edits to your project's articles by users you invited to the project with a fairly speedy query like this:
<code>SELECT * FROM somewiki.revision AS r, yourdb.invited_yourprojectname AS i, yourdb.articles_yourprojectname AS a WHERE 
r.rev_user = i.user_id AND r.rev_page = a.page_id;</code>

You can populate this table with articles from multiple super- and sub-categories 
(e.g. WikiProject_Milkshake_articles, Milkshake_stubs) by reading the category tree. There are multiple ways to do this
(API, <code>somewiki.categorylinks</code>, [http://toolserver.org/~magnus/catscan_rewrite.php external tools]). 
In Reading the Category Tree below, I describe how to do this by querying the Mediawiki database.

== Scripts ==
=== Output of findNewEditors.py ===

The output markup of the invitee report should look like this:

 ===Active new editors===

<code>Below is a list of editors who registered within the last 24 hours, have since made more than 2 edits, and were not blocked at the time the report was generated.</code>
