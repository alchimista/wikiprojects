== Wikitools patches ==

Right now, you have to patch your copy of Wikitools a bit to get some of this to work. In future, we should just make a class, but for now...

* ''wikitools/wiki.py.setSiteInfo: '' apply [http://code.google.com/p/python-wikitools/issues/detail?id=40 this patch] to line 109.

* ''wikitools/page.py.edit:'' add 'sectiontitle' to the list of valid args.
